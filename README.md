<p align = 'justify'>
Every era has its guardian. Once, it was a lone sentinel standing through the night—silent, focused, and unshakable—watching for the faintest sign of danger before it reached the gates.

Today, the battleground has changed, but the need for vigilance has not. Threats now arrive disguised as harmless text: hidden jailbreaks, adversarial prompts, and subtle manipulations aimed at bending Large Language Models out of shape.

Project Vigil is the modern sentinel.
A digital guardian that never sleeps, trained to recognize and intercept malicious intent the moment it appears.

At its heart is a Malicious Prompt Classifier that flags hostile input with the precision of an experienced watchman. Paired with our novel Leave-One-Out Deletion (LOD) technique, Vigil doesn’t simply block attacks—it surgically removes the dangerous fragment while preserving the user’s true intent.

When someone attempts to smuggle a jailbreak into a message, Project Vigil stands firm.
It sees the threat.
It isolates the harm.
It keeps communication safe.

Project Vigil protects the integrity of your AI—quietly, continuously, and without ever breaking the flow of conversation.
